Using the search endpoint of the Giphy API the user is able to retrieve 9 gifs pertaining to the button they clicked on within an animal theme that I chose.  The user is also able to create a new button with a topic of their choice, animal or otherwise, then click on it to retrieve 9 new gifs related to that search term.  Whenever a button is clicked the old gifs are wiped away and the new gifs are put in their place.
